# You are given an integer array cost where cost[i] is the cost of ith step on
#   a staircase.
#   Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps.

# You can either start from the step with index 0, or the step with index 1.

# Return the minimum cost to reach the top of the floor.


# Example 1:

# Input: cost = [10,15,20]
# Output: 15
# Explanation: You will start at index 1.
# - Pay 15 and climb two steps to reach the top.
# The total cost is 15.
